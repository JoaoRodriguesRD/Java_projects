Since I was a teenager I have always been passionate about machines and always tried to find out how they work, at 14 I took a technical course in computer maintenance and was invited to join the Microlins team as Maintenance Assistant, in 2015 I did a technical course on network maintenance and wifi as well I introduced programming. In the free time I strive to learn how to program in C # language using SQL server database. I currently do computer science, I am fulfilling my dream of working with computers and I hope to stand out as a scientist and information technologist.
